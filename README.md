Fireboy & Watergirl: Forest Temple on Spartan-7 FPGA 🔥💧🌲🎮
  
  Welcome to our Fireboy & Watergirl in the Forest Temple project! This is the final project for UIUC's ECE385 Digital Systems Laboratory. Our objective was to faithfully recreate the first level of the classic cooperative platformer game Fireboy & Watergirl on the Spartan-7 FPGA using SystemVerilog. We meticulously developed and integrated various modules, including character movement, collision detection, interactive environment elements, and a color mapping system to deliver an engaging two-player experience. Check out our video demonstration to see the game in action.
